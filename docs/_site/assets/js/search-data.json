Testing Group Policy Objects: . | First: created a very basic gpo with just a name and comment | Second: before even deciding what to do in the gpo I link it through powershell to the OU | . Appling a policy: . | The policy should now be visible in the Group Policy Management Application | Then you can right click it to edit and find what you want to do | For the control panel it is pretty straight-forward as there is an adminstrative preset | So I went in to the policy called prohibit access to control panel and enabled/applied it | . Another way to link: . | While the powershell linking should work most of the time. You can also link it in the GPMC | So to do that you simply drag the GPO into the ou you want it to apply to. | . Trying to use Control Panel: . | Since this user is a part of the affected OU they are not able to access the control panel! | . Some thoughts: . | I had to add the user to the OU since a group member doesn’t inherit the group ou gpo’s | My current plan to make this better would be to automate it. | Specifically if they were added to a group with ou they would automatically be added to it on creation and activation. | .
